\usage{
  frequence(X, m = ncol(X))
}
\arguments{
  \item{X}{a matrix containing ranks.}

  \item{m}{a vector with the size of rank of each
  dimension.}
}
\value{
  A matrix containing all the different observed ranks with
  their observation frequencies in the last column.
}
\description{
  This function takes in input a matrix containing all the
  observed ranks (a rank can be repeated) and returns a
  matrix containing all the different observed ranks with
  their observation frequencies (in the last column).
