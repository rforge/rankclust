\usage{
  rankclust(data, m = ncol(data), K = 1, criterion = "bic",
    algorithm = "SEM", Qsem = 100, Bsem = 20,
    RjSE = m * (m - 1)/2, RjM = m * (m - 1)/2, Ql = 500,
    Bl = 100, maxItEM = 30, epsEM = 1e-06, maxTry = 3,
    run = 1, detail = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
  \item{data}{a matrix in which each row is a ranking
  (partial or not; for partial ranking, missing elements
  must be 0). For multivariate rankings, dimensions are
  placed end to end in each row.}

  \item{m}{a vector composed of the sizes of the rankings
  of each dimension (default value is the number of column
  of the matrix data)}

  \item{K}{an integer or a vector of integer with the
  number of clusters}

  \item{criterion}{criterion "bic" or "icl", criterion to
  minimize for selecting the number of clusters}

  \item{algorithm}{type of algorithm : "EM" (only for
  complete rank) or "SEM" for SEM-Gibbs algorithm(default
  value)}

  \item{Qsem}{the total number of iterations for the SEM
  algorithm (defaut value=40)}

  \item{Bsem}{burn-in period for SEM algorithm (default
  value=10)}

  \item{RjSE}{a vector containing, for each dimension, the
  number of iterations of the Gibbs sampler used in the SE
  step for partial rankings and presentation orders
  generation (only for SEM algorithm, default
  value=mj(mj-1)/2)}

  \item{RjM}{a vector containing, for each dimension, the
  number of iterations of the Gibbs sampler used in the M
  step (only for SEM algorithm, default value=mj(mj-1)/2)}

  \item{Ql}{number of iterations of the Gibbs sampler for
  estimation of log-likelihood (only for SEM algorithm,
  default value=100)}

  \item{Bl}{burn-in period for estimation of log-likelihood
  (only for SEM algorithm, default value=50)}

  \item{maxItEM}{the maximum number of iterations of the EM
  algorithm (defaut value=30)}

  \item{epsEM}{the threshold for loglikelihood convergency
  (only for EM algorithm, defaut value=1e-6)}

  \item{maxTry}{maximum number of restarts of the SEM-Gibbs
  algorithm in the case of non convergence (default
  value=3).}

  \item{run}{number of runs of the algorithm for each value
  of K}

  \item{detail}{boolean, if TRUE, time and others
  informations will be print during the process (default
  value FALSE)}
}
\value{
  an object of class rankclust

  For example : res=rankclust(data,K=1:2,m=m)

  You can access the result by res[number of
  groups]@slotName where slotName is an element of the
  class Output.

\description{
  This functions estimates a clustering of ranking data,
  potentially multivariate and partial, based on a mixture
  of multivariate ISR model [2]. By specifying only one
  cluster, the function perform a modelling of the ranking
  data using the multivariate ISR model. The estimation is
  performed thanks to a SEM-Gibbs algorithm in the general
  case, and an EM algorithm is available for full
  univariate ranking data.
