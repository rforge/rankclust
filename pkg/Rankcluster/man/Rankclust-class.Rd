\description{
This class contains results of rankclust function.
}
\details{
\describe{
  \item{K}{a vector of the number of clusters.}
  \item{data}{the data used for clustering.}
  \item{criterion}{the model selection criterion used.}
  \item{convergence}{a boolean indicating if none problem of empty class has been encountered (for
any number of clusters).}
  \item{results}{a list of \link{Output-class}, containing the results for each number of clusters (one
element of the list is associated to one number of clusters).}
}

If res is the result of rankclust(), each slot of results can be reached by res[k]@slotname, where
k is the number of clusters and slotname is the name of the slot we want to reach (see \link{Output-class}).
For the slots ll, bic, icl, res["slotname"] returns a vector of size K containing the values of the
slot for each number of clusters.
