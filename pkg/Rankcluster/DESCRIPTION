Description: This package proposes the first model-based clustering algorithm
    dedicated to multivariate partial ranking data. This is an extension of the
    Insertion Sorting Rank (ISR) model for ranking data, which is a meaningful
    and effective model obtained by modelling the ranking generating process
    assumed to be a sorting algorithm. The heterogeneity of the rank population
    is modelled by a mixture of ISR, whereas conditional independence
    assumption allows the exension to multivariate ranking.
